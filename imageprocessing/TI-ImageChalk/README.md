## Layers 

### Opencv

To create the opencv layer follow the instruction [here](https://github.com/iandow/opencv_aws_lambda)

Upload the `zip` archive to an `S3` bucket. 

The `zip` archives need to have the following structure `cv2-python38.zip\python\lib\python3.8\site-packages` or `cv2-python37.zip\python\lib\python3.7\site-packages` to work as AWS layers.

**The opencv release contains the zip binaries**

### Background image

Create a `zip` archive with the following structure `baseimage.zip\baseimage\python\blackboard_wide_2.png` and upload it to an `S3` bucket.
